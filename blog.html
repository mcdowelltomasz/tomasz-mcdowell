    <h3>A New Journey</h3>
    <p>
      I'm beginning my journey to become a web developer! I'm enrolled in a coding bootcamp in Portland, Oregon called Epicodus.
      While I'm there I'll learn the basics of HTML & CSS, then Javascript. After that we'll be learning C# and finally React. 
      As you can hopefully tell, I've started on my own! I'm working through <a href=https://freecodecamp.org>freeCodeCamp</a> as much as I can. 
      I've just finished the first certificate they offer, <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc8e8c4a11-9b47-4868-b719-5bd0870ee6a9/responsive-web-design>
      Responsive Web Design</a>, and now I'm working on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. Writing recursive functions and regular expressions has certainly thrown me 
      for a loop! I plan to keep this blog updated, and fix all the formatting issues I have now. Super excited!!
